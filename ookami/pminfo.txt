mem.physmem
Help:
The value of this metric corresponds to the "MemTotal" field
reported by /proc/meminfo. Note that this does not necessarily
correspond to actual installed physical memory - there may
be areas of the physical address space mapped as ROM in
various peripheral devices and the bios may be mirroring
certain ROMs in RAM.

mem.freemem
Help:
free system memory metric from /proc/meminfo

mem.util.used
Help:
Used memory is the difference between mem.physmem and mem.freemem.

mem.util.free
Help:
Alias for mem.freemem.

mem.util.shared
Help:
Shared memory metric. Currently always zero on Linux 2.4 kernels
and has been removed from 2.6 kernels.

mem.util.bufmem
Help:
Memory allocated for buffer_heads.

mem.util.cached
Help:
Memory used by the page cache, including buffered file data.
This is in-memory cache for files read from the disk (the pagecache)
but doesn't include SwapCached.

mem.util.other
Help:
Memory that is not free (i.e. has been referenced) and is not cached.
mem.physmem - mem.util.free - mem.util.cached - mem.util.buffers

mem.util.swapCached
Help:
Memory that once was swapped out, is swapped back in but still also
is in the swapfile (if memory is needed it doesn't need to be swapped
out AGAIN because it is already in the swapfile. This saves I/O)

mem.util.active
Help:
Memory that has been used more recently and usually not reclaimed unless
absolutely necessary.

mem.util.inactive
Help:
Memory which has been less recently used.  It is more eligible to be
reclaimed for other purposes

mem.util.highTotal
Help:
This is apparently an i386 specific metric, and seems to be always zero
on ia64 architecture (and possibly others). On i386 arch (at least),
highmem is all memory above ~860MB of physical memory. Highmem areas
are for use by userspace programs, or for the pagecache. The kernel
must use tricks to access this memory, making it slower to access
than lowmem.

mem.util.highFree
Help:
See mem.util.highTotal. Not used on ia64 arch (and possibly others).

mem.util.lowTotal
Help:
Lowmem is memory which can be used for everything that highmem can be
used for, but it is also availble for the kernel's use for its own
data structures. Among many other things, it is where everything
from the Slab is allocated.  Bad things happen when you're out of lowmem.
(this may only be true on i386 architectures).

mem.util.lowFree
Help:
See mem.util.lowTotal

mem.util.swapTotal
Help:
total amount of swap space available

mem.util.mapped
Help:
files which have been mmaped, such as libraries

mem.util.slab
Help:
in-kernel data structures cache

mem.util.committed_AS
Help:
An estimate of how much RAM you would need to make a 99.99% guarantee
that there never is OOM (out of memory) for this workload. Normally
the kernel will overcommit memory. That means, say you do a 1GB malloc,
nothing happens, really. Only when you start USING that malloc memory
you will get real memory on demand, and just as much as you use.

disk.dev.avactive
Help:
Counts the number of milliseconds for which at least one I/O is in
progress for each device.

When converted to a rate, this metric represents the average utilization of
the disk during the sampling interval.  A value of 0.5 (or 50%) means the
disk was active (i.e. busy) half the time.

disk.dev.read_rawactive
Help:
For each completed read on each disk the response time (queue time plus
service time) in milliseconds is added to the associated instance of
this metric.

When converted to a normalized rate, the value represents the time average
of the number of outstanding reads for a disk.  When divided by the number
of completed reads for a disk (disk.dev.read), the value represents the
stochastic average of the read response (or wait) time for that disk.

It is suitable mainly for use in calculations with other metrics,
e.g. mirroring the results from existing performance tools:

 iostat.dev.r_await = delta(disk.dev.read_rawactive) / delta(disk.dev.read)

disk.dev.write_rawactive
Help:
For each completed write on each disk the response time (queue time plus
service time) in milliseconds is added to the associated instance of
this metric.

When converted to a normalized rate, the value represents the time
average of the number of outstanding writes for a disk.  When divided by
the number of completed writes for a disk (disk.dev.write), the value
represents the stochastic average of the write response (or wait)
time for that disk.

It is suitable mainly for use in calculations with other metrics,
e.g. mirroring the results from existing performance tools:

 iostat.dev.w_await = delta(disk.dev.write_rawactive) / delta(disk.dev.write)

disk.dev.total_rawactive
Help:
For each completed I/O on each disk the response time (queue time plus
service time) in milliseconds is added to the associated instance of
this metric.

When converted to a normalized rate, the value represents the time average
of the number of outstanding I/Os for a disk.  When divided by the number
of completed I/Os for a disk (disk.dev.total), the value represents the
stochastic average of the I/O response (or wait) time for that disk.

It is suitable mainly for use in calculations with other metrics,
e.g. mirroring the results from existing performance tools:

 iostat.dev.await = delta(disk.dev.total_rawactive) / delta(disk.dev.total)

disk.dev.aveq
Help:
When converted to a rate, this metric represents the time averaged disk
request queue length during the sampling interval.  A value of 2.5 (or 250%)
represents a time averaged queue length of 2.5 requests during the sampling
interval.

disk.dev.scheduler
Help:
The name of the I/O scheduler in use for each device.  The scheduler
is part of the block layer in the kernel, and attempts to optimise the
I/O submission patterns using various techniques (typically, sorting
and merging adjacent requests into larger ones to reduce seek activity,
but certainly not limited to that).

Help:
Counts the number of milliseconds for which at least one I/O is in
progress on each disk, summed across all disks.

When converted to a rate and divided by the number of disks (hinv.ndisk),
this metric represents the average utilization of all disks during the
sampling interval.  A value of 0.25 (or 25%) means that on average every
disk was active (i.e. busy) one quarter of the time.

disk.all.read_rawactive
Help:
For each completed read on every disk the response time (queue time plus
service time) in milliseconds is added to this metric.

When converted to a normalized rate, the value represents the time average
of the number of outstanding reads across all disks.  When divided
by the number of completed reads for all disks (disk.all.read), value
represents the stochastic average of the read response (or wait) time
across all disks.

It is suitable mainly for use in calculations with other metrics,
e.g. mirroring the results from existing performance tools:

mmv.control.reload
Help:
Writing anything other then 0 to this metric will result in
re-reading directory and re-mapping files.

pmcd.datasize
Help:
This metric returns the amount of memory in kilobytes allocated for the
data segment of PMCD and any DSO agents (PMDAs) that it has loaded.

This is handy for tracing memory utilization (and leaks) in DSOs during
development.

pmcd.numagents
Help:
The number of agents (PMDAs) currently connected to PMCD.  This may differ
from the number of agents configured in $PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH if agents have
terminated and/or been timed-out by PMCD.

pmcd.numclients
Help:
The number of connections open to client programs retrieving information
from PMCD.

pmcd.timezone
Help:
Value for the $TZ environment variable where the PMCD is running.
Enables determination of "local" time for timestamps returned via
PMCD from a remote host.

pmcd.simabi
Help:
SIM is the subprogram interface model (originally from the MIPS object
code formats), and ABI is the application binary interface.  Both
relate to the way the PMCD binary was compiled and linked.

Usually DSO PMDAs must be compiled and linked in the same way before
they can be used with PMCD.

On some platforms this metric is not available.

pmcd.version
Help:
PMCD version

pmcd.services
Help:
A space-separated string representing all running PCP services with PID
files in $PCP_RUN_DIR (such as pmcd itself, pmproxy and a few others).

pmcd.openfds
Help:
The highest file descriptor index used by PMCD for a Client or PMDA
connection.

pmcd.build
Help:
Minor part of the PCP build version numbering.  For example on Linux
with RPM packaging, if the PCP RPM version is pcp-2.5.99-20070323 then
pmcd.build returns the string "20070323".

pmcd.hostname
Help:
A reasonably unique identifier of the PMCD installation, for use
by pmlogger or other tools to identify the source principal of
the data (as distinct from identifying the connection/protocol
used to reach it).

pmcd.sighups
Help:
count of SIGHUP signals pmcd has received

pmcd.pid
Help:
PID for the current pmcd invocation

pmcd.seqnum
Help:

The configuration sequence number starts at 1 when pmcd is started
and is incremented by 1 each time a PMDA is started or restarted.

So all the while the value of pmcd.seqnum remains constant we can
assert the data from all the PMDAs forms a continuous time series
and in particular no counters or other metrics have been reset due
to a PMDA start/restart.

pmcd.labels
Help:
Additional end-user and PMCS metadata can be associated with performance
metrics via $PCP_SYSCONF_DIR/labels files.  This metric exports the user
defined labels that will be reported by pmGetContextLabels(3).  This set
does not include labels automatically associated with every context such
as the hostname, user and group identifier, container identifier, etc.

pmcd.control.debug
Help:
The current value of the PMCD debug flags.  This is a bit-wise OR of the
flags described in the output of pmdbg -l.  The PMCD-specific flags are:

    DBG_TRACE_APPL0       2048  Trace agent & client I/O and termination
    DBG_TRACE_APPL1       4096  Trace host access control
    DBG_TRACE_APPL2       8192  Trace config file scanner and parser

It is possible to store values into this metric, see the -ol options for
pmdbg(1) to help determine appropriate values for the debug flags.

Diagnostic output is written to the PMCD log file (usually
$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/pmcd.log).

pmcd.control.timeout
Help:
PDU exchanges with agents (PMDAs) managed by PMCD are subject to timeouts
which detect and clean up slow or disfunctional agents.  This metric
returns the current timeout period in seconds being used for the agents.
If the value is zero, timeouts are not being used.  This corresponds to
the -t option described in the man page, pmcd(1).

It is possible to store a new timeout value into this metric.  Storing zero
will turn off timeouts.  Subsequent storing of a non-zero value will turn
on the timeouts again.

pmcd.control.register
Help:
A vector of 16 32-bit registers that are identified by the instance
identifiers 0 through 15.

The register contents are initially zero, but may be subsequently
modified to be an arbitrary value using pmStore(3) or pmstore(1).

The values are not used internally, but rather act as a repository into
which operational information might be stored, and then exported to
modify the behavior of client programs, e.g. inhibit pmie(1) rule
firing, or trigger a status indicator.  In this way,
pmcd.control.register acts like a primitive bulletin board.

Example use might be as follows
    register[0]	telephone no. of person assigned to current system problem
    register[1]	telephone no. of person assigned to current network problem
    register[2]	ORACLE database is down
    register[3]	backup in progress
    register[4]	shopping days to Christmas

pmcd.control.traceconn
Help:
Set to 1 to enable PMCD event tracing for all connection-related
events for clients and PMDAs.

Set to 0 to disable PMCD connection event tracing.

pmcd.control.tracepdu
Help:
Set to 1 to enable PMCD event tracing for all PDUs sent and received
by PMCD.

Set to 0 to disable PMCD PDU event tracing.

pmcd.control.tracenobuf
Help:
Set to 1 to enable unbuffered PMCD event tracing, where each event is
reported as it happens.

Set to 0 to enable buffering of PMCD event traces (this is the default),
and event traces will only be dumped or reported when an error occurs or
a value is stored into the PCP metric pmcd.control.dumptrace.

pmcd.control.tracebufs
Help:
Defaults to 20.  May be changed dynamically.

pmcd.control.dumptrace
Help:
Storing any value into this metric causes the PMCD event trace buffers to
be dumped to PMCD's log file.

pmcd.control.dumpconn
Help:
Storing any value into this metric causes the details of the current PMCD
client connections to be dumped to PMCD's log file.

pmcd.control.sighup
Help:
Storing any value into this metric causes PMCD to be reset by sending
itself a SIGHUP signal.

On reset (either by storing into pmcd.control.sighup or by sending PMCD a
SIGHUP directly), PMCD will restart any failed PMDAs and reload the PMNS
if it has been changed.

pmcd.agent.type
Help:
From $PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH, this metric encodes the PMDA type as follows:
	(x << 1) | y
where "x" is the IPC type between PMCD and the PMDA, i.e. 0 for DSO, 1
for socket or 2 for pipe, and "y" is the message passing style, i.e.
0 for binary or 1 for ASCII.

pmcd.agent.status
Help:
This metric encodes the current status of each PMDA.  The default value
is 0 if the PMDA is active.

Other values encode various degrees of PMDA difficulty in three bit fields
(bit 0 is the low-order bit) as follows:

bits 7..0
    1   the PMDA is connected, but not yet "ready" to accept requests
        from the PMDA
    2   the PMDA has exited of its own accord
    4   some error prevented the PMDA being started
    8   PMCD stopped communication with the PMDA due to a protocol or
        timeout error

bits 15..8
        the exit() status from the PMDA

bits 23..16
        the number of the signal that terminated the PMDA

pmcd.agent.fenced
Help:
A value of zero indicates not enabled, one indicates that operations
requiring fetch-level access controls are currently being denied and
PM_ERR_PMDAFENCED error code returned, for each PMDA.

The fence status is initially zero for all PMDAs, but may be subsequently
modified to start and stop fencing using pmStore(3) or pmstore(1).  Note:
only root may store to this metric and the PMCD PMDA cannot be fenced (it
will be silently ignored if attempted).

pmcd.pmlogger.host
Help:
The fully qualified domain name of the host on which a pmlogger
instance is running.

The instance names are process IDs of the active pmloggers.  The
primary pmlogger has an extra instance with the instance name "primary"
and an instance ID of zero (in addition to its normal process ID
instance).

pmcd.pmlogger.port
Help:
Each pmlogger instance has a port for receiving log control
information.  This metric is a list of the active pmlogger control
ports on the same machine as this PMCD (i.e. the host identified in the
corresponding pmcd.pmlogger.host metric).

The instance names are process IDs of the active pmloggers.  The
primary pmlogger has an extra instance with the instance name "primary"
and an instance ID of zero (in addition to its normal process ID
instance).

pmcd.pmlogger.archive
Help:
The full pathname through the filesystem on the corresponding host
(pmcd.pmlogger.host) that is the base name for the archive log files.

The instance names are process IDs of the active pmloggers.  The
primary pmlogger has an extra instance with the instance name "primary"
and an instance ID of zero (in addition to its normal process ID
instance).

pmcd.pmlogger.pmcd_host
Help:
The fully qualified domain name of the host from which a pmlogger
instance is fetching metrics to be archived.

The instance names are process IDs of the active pmloggers.  The
primary pmlogger has an extra instance with the instance name "primary"
and an instance ID of zero (in addition to its normal process ID
instance).

pmcd.pmie.configfile
Help:
The full path in the filesystem to the configuration file containing the
rules being evaluated by each pmie instance.

If the configuration file was supplied on the standard input, then this
metric will have the value "<stdin>".  If multiple configuration files were
given to pmie, then the value of this metric will be the first configuration
file specified.

pmcd.pmie.logfile
Help:
The file to which each instance of pmie is writting events.  No two pmie
instances can share the same log file.  If no logfile was specified when
pmie was started, this metrics has the value "<none>".  All daemon pmie
instances started through pmie_check(1) must have an associated log file.

pmcd.pmie.pmcd_host
Help:
The default host from which pmie is fetching metrics.  This is either the
hostname given to pmie on the command line or the local host.  Note that this
does not consider host names specified in the pmie configuration file (these
are considered non-default and can be more than one per pmie instance).
All daemon pmie instances started through pmie_check(1) will have their
default host passed in on their command line.

pmcd.pmie.numrules
Help:
The total number of rules being evaluated by each pmie process.

pmcd.pmie.actions
Help:
A cumulative count of the evaluated pmie rules which have evaluated to true.

This value is incremented once each time an action is executed.  This value
will always be less than or equal to pmcd.pmie.eval.true because predicates
which have evaluated to true may be suppressed in the action part of the
pmie rule, in which case this counter will not be incremented.

pmcd.pmie.eval.true
Help:
The predicate part of a pmie rule can be said to evaluate to either true,
false, or not known.  This metric is a cumulative count of the number of
rules which have evaluated to true for each pmie instance.

pmcd.pmie.eval.false
Help:
The predicate part of a pmie rule can be said to evaluate to either true,
false, or not known.  This metric is a cumulative count of the number of
rules which have evaluated to false for each pmie instance.

pmcd.pmie.eval.unknown
Help:
The predicate part of a pmie rule can be said to evaluate to either true,
false, or not known.  This metric is a cumulative count of the number of
rules which have not been successfully evaluated.  This could be due to not
yet having sufficient values to evaluate the rule, or a metric fetch may
have been unsuccessful in retrieving current values for metrics required
for evaluation of the rule.

pmcd.pmie.eval.expected
Help:
This is the expected rate of evaluation of pmie rules.  The value is
calculated once when pmie starts, and is the number of pmie rules divided
by the average time interval over which they are to be evaluated.

pmcd.pmie.eval.actual
Help:
A cumulative count of the pmie rules which have been evaluated.

This value is incremented once for each evaluation of each rule.

pmcd.buf.alloc
Help:
This metric returns the number of allocated buffers for the various buffer
pools used by pmcd.

This is handy for tracing memory utilization (and leaks) in DSOs during
development.

pmcd.buf.free
Help:
This metric returns the number of free buffers for the various buffer
pools used by pmcd.

This is handy for tracing memory utilization (and leaks) in DSOs during
development.

pmcd.client.whoami
Help:
This metric is defined over an instance domain containing one entry
per active client of pmcd.  The instance number is a sequence number
for each client (restarts at 0 each time pmcd is restarted).  The value
of the metric by default is the IP address of the client.

Clients can optionally use pmStore to modify their own "whoami" string
to provide more useful information about the client.

pmcd.client.start_date
Help:
The date and time in ctime(2) format on which the client connected
to pmcd.

pmcd.client.container
Help:
The name of the container (if any) associated with this context at
the time of the fetch request.  The container name can be set when
establishing a PMAPI context, or by storing into this metric using
the pmStore interface.

pmcd.cputime.total
Help:
Sum of user and system time since pmcd started.

pmcd.cputime.per_pdu_in
Help:
When first requested it is the average since pmcd started, so
pmcd.cputime.total divided by pmcd.pdu_in.total.

Subsequent fetches by a PMAPI client will return the average CPU
time per PDU received by pmcd (for all clients) since the last time
the PMAPI client fetched this metric.

cgroup.cpusched.cfs_period
Help:
The bandwidth allowed for a CFS group is specified using a quota and period.
Within each given "period" (usec), a group is allowed to consume only up to
"quota" usec of CPU time.  When the CPU bandwidth consumption of a group
exceeds this limit (for that period), the tasks belonging to its hierarchy
will be throttled and are not allowed to run again until the next period.
Further discussion in Documentation/scheduler/sched-bwc.txt in the kernel
sources.

cgroup.cpusched.cfs_quota
Help:
The bandwidth allowed for a CFS group is specified using a quota and period.
Within each given "period" (usec), a group is allowed to consume only up to
"quota" usec of CPU time.  When the CPU bandwidth consumption of a group
exceeds this limit (for that period), the tasks belonging to its hierarchy
will be throttled and are not allowed to run again until the next period.

hotproc.control.refresh
Help:
Controls how long it takes before the "interesting" process list is refreshed
and new cpuburn times (see hotproc.cpuburn) calculated.  This value can be
changed at any time by using pmstore(1). Once the value is changed, the instances
will not be available until after the new refresh period has elapsed.

hotproc.control.config
Help:
The configuration predicate that is used to characterize "interesting"
processes.  This will initially be the predicate as specified in the
configuration file.  This value can be changed at any time by using
pmstore(1).  Once the value is changed, the instances will not be available
until after the refresh period has elapsed.

hotproc.control.config_gen
Help:
Each time the configuration predicate is updated (see hotproc.control.config)
the configuration generation number is incremented.

hotproc.control.reload_config
Help:
Instructs the pmda to reload its configuration file.  This value can be
changed at any time by using pmstore(1). Once the value is changed, the instances
will not be available until after the new refresh period has elapsed.

hotproc.total.cpuidle
Help:
The fraction of all CPU time classified as idle over the last refresh
interval.

hotproc.total.cpuburn
Help:
The sum of the CPU utilization ("cpuburn" or the fraction of time that each
process was executing in user or system mode over the last refresh interval)
for all the "interesting" processes.

Values are in the range 0 to the number of CPUs.

hotproc.total.cpuother.transient
Help:
The total CPU utilization (fraction of time that each process was executing
in user or system mode) for processes which are not present throughout
the most recent refreshes interval.  The hotproc PMDA is limited to
selecting processes which are present throughout each refresh intervals.
If processes come and/or go during a refresh interval then they will never
be considered.  This metric gives an indication of the level of activity of
these "transient" processes.  If the value is large in comparison to the
sum of hotproc.total.cpuburn and hotproc.total.cpuother.not_cpuburn then
the "transient" processes are consuming lots of CPU time.  Under these
circumstances, the hotproc PMDA may be less useful, or consideration
should be given to decreasing the value of the refresh interval
(hotproc.control.refresh) so fewer "transient" processes escape
consideration.

Values are in the range 0 to the number of CPUs.

hotproc.total.cpuother.not_cpuburn
Help:
The sum of the CPU utilization ("cpuburn" or the fraction of time that
each process was executing in user or system mode over the last refresh
interval) for all the "uninteresting" processes.  If this value is high in
comparison to hotproc.total.cpuburn, then configuration predicate of the
hotproc PMDA is classifying a significant fraction of the CPU utilization
to processes that are not "interesting".

Values are in the range 0 to the number of CPUs.

hotproc.total.cpuother.total
Help:
Non-idle CPU utilization not accounted for by processes other than those
deemed "interesting".  It is equivalent to hotproc.total.cpuother.not_cpuburn
+ hotproc.total.cpuother.transient.

Values are in the range 0 to the number of CPUs.

hotproc.total.cpuother.percent
Help:
Gives an indication of how much of the CPU time the "transient" processes
and the "uninteresting" processes are accounting for.  Computed as:
    100 * hotproc.total.cpuother.total / number of CPUs

xfs.dir_ops.lookup
Help:
This is a count of the number of file name directory lookups in XFS
filesystems. It counts only those lookups which miss in the operating
system's directory name lookup cache and must search the real directory
structure for the name in question.  The count is incremented once for
each level of a pathname search that results in a directory lookup.

xfs.dir_ops.create
Help:
This is the number of times a new directory entry was created in XFS
filesystems. Each time that a new file, directory, link, symbolic link,
or special file is created in the directory hierarchy the count is
incremented.

xfs.dir_ops.remove
Help:
This is the number of times an existing directory entry was removed in
XFS filesystems. Each time that a file, directory, link, symbolic link,
or special file is removed from the directory hierarchy the count is
incremented.

xfs.dir_ops.getdents
Help:
This is the number of times the XFS directory getdents operation was
performed. The getdents operation is used by programs to read the
contents of directories in a file system independent fashion.  This
count corresponds exactly to the number of times the getdents(2) system
call was successfully used on an XFS directory.

xfs.transactions.sync
Help:
This is the number of meta-data transactions which waited to be
committed to the on-disk log before allowing the process performing the
transaction to continue. These transactions are slower and more
expensive than asynchronous transactions, because they force the in
memory log buffers to be forced to disk more often and they wait for
the completion of the log buffer writes.

xfs.transactions.async
Help:
This is the number of meta-data transactions which did not wait to be
committed to the on-disk log before allowing the process performing the
transaction to continue. These transactions are faster and more
efficient than synchronous transactions, because they commit their data
to the in memory log buffers without forcing those buffers to be
written to disk. This allows multiple asynchronous transactions to be
committed to disk in a single log buffer write. Most transactions used
in XFS file systems are asynchronous.

xfs.transactions.empty
Help:
This is the number of meta-data transactions which did not actually
change anything. These are transactions which were started for some
purpose, but in the end it turned out that no change was necessary.

xfs.inode_ops.ig_attempts
Help:
This is the number of times the operating system looked for an XFS
inode in the inode cache. Whether the inode was found in the cache or
needed to be read in from the disk is not indicated here, but this can
be computed from the ig_found and ig_missed counts.

xfs.inode_ops.ig_found
Help:
This is the number of times the operating system looked for an XFS
inode in the inode cache and found it. The closer this count is to the
ig_attempts count the better the inode cache is performing.

xfs.inode_ops.ig_frecycle
Help:
This is the number of times the operating system looked for an XFS
inode in the inode cache and saw that it was there but was unable to
use the in memory inode because it was being recycled by another
process.

xfs.inode_ops.ig_missed
Help:
This is the number of times the operating system looked for an XFS
inode in the inode cache and the inode was not there. The further this
count is from the ig_attempts count the better.

xfs.inode_ops.ig_dup
Help:
This is the number of times the operating system looked for an XFS
inode in the inode cache and found that it was not there but upon
attempting to add the inode to the cache found that another process had
already inserted it.

xfs.inode_ops.ig_reclaims
Help:
This is the number of times the operating system recycled an XFS inode
from the inode cache in order to use the memory for that inode for
another purpose. Inodes are recycled in order to keep the inode cache
from growing without bound. If the reclaim rate is high it may be
beneficial to raise the vnode_free_ratio kernel tunable variable to
increase the size of inode cache.

xfs.inode_ops.ig_attrchg
Help:
This is the number of times the operating system explicitly changed the
attributes of an XFS inode. For example, this could be to change the
inode's owner, the inode's size, or the inode's timestamps.

xfs.log.writes
Help:
This variable counts the number of log buffer writes going to the
physical log partitions of XFS filesystems. Log data traffic is
proportional to the level of meta-data updating. Log buffer writes get
generated when they fill up or external syncs occur.

xfs.log.blocks
Help:
This variable counts the number of Kbytes of information being written
to the physical log partitions of XFS filesystems. Log data traffic
is proportional to the level of meta-data updating. The rate with which
log data gets written depends on the size of internal log buffers and
disk write speed. Therefore, filesystems with very high meta-data
updating may need to stripe the log partition or put the log partition
on a separate drive.

xfs.log.write_ratio
Help:
The ratio of log blocks written to log writes.  If block count isn't a
"reasonable" multiple of writes, then many small log writes are being
performed - this is suboptimal.  Perfection is 64.  Fine-grain control
can be obtained when this metric is used in conjuntion with pmstore(1)
and the xfs.control.reset metric.

xfs.log.noiclogs
Help:
This variable keeps track of times when a logged transaction can not
get any log buffer space. When this occurs, all of the internal log
buffers are busy flushing their data to the physical on-disk log.

xfs.xstrat.bytes
Help:
This is the number of bytes of file data flushed out by the XFS
flushing daemons.

xfs.xstrat.quick
Help:
This is the number of buffers flushed out by the XFS flushing daemons
which are written to contiguous space on disk. The buffers handled by
the XFS daemons are delayed allocation buffers, so this count gives an
indication of the success of the XFS daemons in allocating contiguous
disk space for the data being flushed to disk.

xfs.xstrat.split
Help:
This is the number of buffers flushed out by the XFS flushing daemons
which are written to non-contiguous space on disk. The buffers handled
by the XFS daemons are delayed allocation buffers, so this count gives
an indication of the failure of the XFS daemons in allocating
contiguous disk space for the data being flushed to disk. Large values
in this counter indicate that the file system has become fragmented.

xfs.perdev.dir_ops.lookup
Help:
This is a count of the number of file name directory lookups in XFS
filesystems. It counts only those lookups which miss in the operating
system's directory name lookup cache and must search the real directory
structure for the name in question.  The count is incremented once for
each level of a pathname search that results in a directory lookup.

xfs.perdev.dir_ops.create
Help:
This is the number of times a new directory entry was created in XFS
filesystems. Each time that a new file, directory, link, symbolic link,
or special file is created in the directory hierarchy the count is
incremented.

xfs.perdev.dir_ops.remove
Help:
This is the number of times an existing directory entry was removed in
XFS filesystems. Each time that a file, directory, link, symbolic link,
or special file is removed from the directory hierarchy the count is
incremented.

xfs.perdev.dir_ops.getdents
Help:
This is the number of times the XFS directory getdents operation was
performed. The getdents operation is used by programs to read the
contents of directories in a file system independent fashion.  This
count corresponds exactly to the number of times the getdents(2) system
call was successfully used on an XFS directory.

xfs.perdev.transactions.sync
Help:
This is the number of meta-data transactions which waited to be
committed to the on-disk log before allowing the process performing the
transaction to continue. These transactions are slower and more
expensive than asynchronous transactions, because they force the in
memory log buffers to be forced to disk more often and they wait for
the completion of the log buffer writes.

xfs.perdev.transactions.async
Help:
This is the number of meta-data transactions which did not wait to be
committed to the on-disk log before allowing the process performing the
transaction to continue. These transactions are faster and more
efficient than synchronous transactions, because they commit their data
to the in memory log buffers without forcing those buffers to be
written to disk. This allows multiple asynchronous transactions to be
committed to disk in a single log buffer write. Most transactions used
in XFS file systems are asynchronous.

xfs.perdev.transactions.empty
Help:
This is the number of meta-data transactions which did not actually
change anything. These are transactions which were started for some
purpose, but in the end it turned out that no change was necessary.

xfs.perdev.inode_ops.ig_attempts
Help:
This is the number of times the operating system looked for an XFS
inode in the inode cache. Whether the inode was found in the cache or
needed to be read in from the disk is not indicated here, but this can
be computed from the ig_found and ig_missed counts.

xfs.perdev.inode_ops.ig_found
Help:
This is the number of times the operating system looked for an XFS
inode in the inode cache and found it. The closer this count is to the
ig_attempts count the better the inode cache is performing.

xfs.perdev.inode_ops.ig_frecycle
Help:
This is the number of times the operating system looked for an XFS
inode in the inode cache and saw that it was there but was unable to
use the in memory inode because it was being recycled by another
process.

xfs.perdev.inode_ops.ig_missed
Help:
This is the number of times the operating system looked for an XFS
inode in the inode cache and the inode was not there. The further this
count is from the ig_attempts count the better.

xfs.perdev.inode_ops.ig_dup
Help:
This is the number of times the operating system looked for an XFS
inode in the inode cache and found that it was not there but upon
attempting to add the inode to the cache found that another process had
already inserted it.

xfs.perdev.inode_ops.ig_reclaims
Help:
This is the number of times the operating system recycled an XFS inode
from the inode cache in order to use the memory for that inode for
another purpose. Inodes are recycled in order to keep the inode cache
from growing without bound. If the reclaim rate is high it may be
beneficial to raise the vnode_free_ratio kernel tunable variable to
increase the size of inode cache.

xfs.perdev.inode_ops.ig_attrchg
Help:
This is the number of times the operating system explicitly changed the
attributes of an XFS inode. For example, this could be to change the
inode's owner, the inode's size, or the inode's timestamps.

xfs.perdev.log.writes
Help:
This variable counts the number of log buffer writes going to the
physical log partitions of XFS filesystems. Log data traffic is
proportional to the level of meta-data updating. Log buffer writes get
generated when they fill up or external syncs occur.

xfs.perdev.log.blocks
Help:
This variable counts the number of Kbytes of information being written
to the physical log partitions of XFS filesystems. Log data traffic
is proportional to the level of meta-data updating. The rate with which
log data gets written depends on the size of internal log buffers and
disk write speed. Therefore, filesystems with very high meta-data
updating may need to stripe the log partition or put the log partition
on a separate drive.

xfs.perdev.log.write_ratio
Help:
The ratio of log blocks written to log writes.  If block count isn't a
"reasonable" multiple of writes, then many small log writes are being
performed - this is suboptimal.  Perfection is 64.  Fine-grain control
can be obtained when this metric is used in conjuntion with pmstore(1)
and the xfs.control.reset metric.

xfs.perdev.log.noiclogs
Help:
This variable keeps track of times when a logged transaction can not
get any log buffer space. When this occurs, all of the internal log
buffers are busy flushing their data to the physical on-disk log.

xfs.perdev.log.force

xfs.perdev.xstrat.bytes
Help:
This is the number of bytes of file data flushed out by the XFS
flushing daemons.

xfs.perdev.xstrat.quick
Help:
This is the number of buffers flushed out by the XFS flushing daemons
which are written to contiguous space on disk. The buffers handled by
the XFS daemons are delayed allocation buffers, so this count gives an
indication of the success of the XFS daemons in allocating contiguous
disk space for the data being flushed to disk.

xfs.perdev.xstrat.split
Help:
This is the number of buffers flushed out by the XFS flushing daemons
which are written to non-contiguous space on disk. The buffers handled
by the XFS daemons are delayed allocation buffers, so this count gives
an indication of the failure of the XFS daemons in allocating
contiguous disk space for the data being flushed to disk. Large values
in this counter indicate that the file system has become fragmented.

proc.control.all.threads
Help:
If set to one, the process instance domain as reported by pmdaproc
contains all threads as well as the processes that started them.
If set to zero, the process instance domain contains only processes.

This setting is persistent for the life of pmdaproc and affects all
client tools that request instances and values from pmdaproc.
Use either pmstore(1) or pmStore(3) to modify this metric.

proc.control.perclient.threads
Help:
If set to one, the process instance domain as reported by pmdaproc
contains all threads as well as the processes that started them.
If set to zero, the process instance domain contains only processes.

This setting is only visible to the active client context.  In other
words, storing into this metric has no effect for other monitoring
tools.  See proc.control.all.threads, if that is the desired outcome.
Only pmStore(3) can effectively set this metric (pmstore(1) cannot).

proc.control.perclient.cgroups
Help:
If set to the empty string (the default), the process instance domain
as reported by pmdaproc contains all processes.  However, a cgroup
name (full path) can be stored into this metric in order to restrict
processes reported to only those within the specified cgroup.  This
set is further affected by the value of proc.control.perclient.threads.

This setting is only visible to the active client context.  In other
words, storing into this metric has no effect for other monitoring
tools.  pmStore(3) must be used to set this metric (not pmstore(1)).
